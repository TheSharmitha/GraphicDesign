This project was developed as part of my Graphic Design Internship.
The goal of this project was to design a complete visual identity for an imaginary robotics company called SHARORA Future of Robotics, focusing on brand representation, communication, and digital marketing.

The project includes:
Posters and Flyers
Logo Design
Business Card Design
Infographic

All designs were created with consistency in colors, typography, and brand personality.# GraphicDesign #oasisinfobyte
